About queues, frames etc.
-------------------------

- Since individual streams within a stream bundle do not necessarily have the same packet rate, each stream must maintain its own queue.

- Therefore, queue sizes should be chosen carefully so as to avoid one queue being full while the other is still being filled.

- Right now, there is no time to properly handle synchronization, which is a complex subject.

- However, it ought to be possible to have the software compute queue sizes automatically from available metadata (frame rate, sample rate and size).

- For now, queues will be allowed to grow indefinitely (with an automatic abort when a generous limit is exceeded)
